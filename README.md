# Deepfake Fraud Detection in Banking: Executive Summary

## Master's in Statistics Capstone Project

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This capstone project addresses the critical cybersecurity challenge of **synthetic identity fraud** in banking systems through an advanced AI-powered detection system. The solution combines deep learning computer vision with natural language processing to identify deepfake and AI-generated content in Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.

### Problem Statement

Financial institutions face increasing threats from synthetic identity attacks, where fraudsters use AI-generated images, videos, and fabricated personal information to create fake identities for:
- Opening fraudulent bank accounts
- Obtaining credit cards and loans
- Money laundering operations
- Identity theft schemes

**Industry Impact**: Synthetic identity fraud costs U.S. financial institutions over $20 billion annually (Federal Reserve, 2021).
